# statsHelper
An elementary program to help save time on my stats homework.

My implementation of sorting, gettting the mean, median, and mode, of a list without using pythons statistics module.

## How to run

Pass in the delimiter of your list on the command line.
The script currently supports ',' as well as ':' and ' ' (space) as arguments

### Example

`python3 orderList.py , `  <--- the comma is what is delimiting my list in this case. 1,2,3,4


`python3 orderList.py : `   1:2:3:4


`python3 orderList.py ' ' `  1 2 3 4
