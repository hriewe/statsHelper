# statsHelper
An elementary program to help save time on my stats homework.

My implementation of common statistical algorithms implemented without the statistics module.
Sorts the list, finds the mean, median, and mode as well as the variance and standard deviation.

## How to run

Pass in the delimiter of your list on the command line.
The script currently supports ',' as well as ':' and ' ' (space) as arguments

### Example

`python3 orderList.py , `  <--- the comma is what is delimiting my list in this case. 1,2,3,4


`python3 orderList.py : `  <--- 1:2:3:4


`python3 orderList.py ' ' `  <--- 1 2 3 4
